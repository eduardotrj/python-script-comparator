# Python Script Performance Comparator

A desktop application built with Tkinter that allows you to compare the performance of two Python scripts side by side. It shows the speed and memory use.

## Features

- **Two Code Input Panels**: Editable text areas for pasting or writing Python code
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures execution time (in milliseconds) and memory usage
- **Variable Tracking**: Captures and displays all user-defined variables and their final values
- **Output Capture**: Captures both stdout and stderr from script execution
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles and displays execution errors
- **Responsive UI**: Uses threading to keep the interface responsive during script execution
- **Real-time Results**: Displays results in separate panels for easy comparison

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library modules
